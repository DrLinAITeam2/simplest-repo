## Why
To demonstrate the OpenSpec workflow with a simple, observable change that updates an existing timestamp after "hello world" for testing non-interactive implementation.

## What Changes
- Update the existing timestamp (current time when change is implemented) in the second div of index.html
- This allows repeated testing to verify latest proposal takes effect by observing timestamp changes

## Impact
- Affected specs: web-content (existing capability)
- Affected code: index.html
