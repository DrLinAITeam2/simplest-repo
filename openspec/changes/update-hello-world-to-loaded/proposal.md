## Why
The current "Hello World" text displayed after the hourglass animation should be changed to "Loaded" to better reflect the application state when the page initialization completes.

## What Changes
- Change the text content from "Hello World" to "Loaded" in the main content div
- Update the page title to reflect the new content

## Impact
- Affected specs: none (this is a simple content change)
- Affected code: index.html (text content and title)
